# IOT Running Display

## Background

I enjoy running but have been struggling with consistency lately. Sometimes I just cannot get out of the door for even a short run.
I wanted to make a running display that would show me how I was doing during the week. So I made this IOT connected LED display.
It shows the following:

- The current day
- If I ran for more than 30min it will display a green dot
- If I didnâ€™t run that day if will show a red dot

The idea is that I will have this hanging in my house and it will be in my face all the time and even my family members will see it. This should motivate me to try get more green dots than red.

## How it works

Consists of:

- 18 neo pixel LEDs
- 1 button
- D1 mini esp8266 board
- 3d printed box

I am using Azure's IOT hub to communicate with my device through the esp board. I am using three azure functions to do the following:

- A http function that does an api call to Strava (the app I use to record my running) to get my weeks running stats. Then it converts this into an array of LED values. Which it sends to an IOT hub topic. The esp is listening for this topic and then displays the result.
- Timer function is used to run every hour. This triggers the http function so I get new results to the topic every hour.
- A IOT event trigger function is also used. This is listening to a topic that gets fired from the display when the button is pushed. It will then like the timer call the http function so that new results are published. I added this because you may be back from a run and want to see the results immediatly and not wait for the timer to run.

### Code

I have 3 directories. 

- 3dprint (stl files for the print)
- esp (the code running on the d1 mini, used platformio in vs code)
- functions (three azure functions, I used the online editor mostly to write these, so this is a copy)
